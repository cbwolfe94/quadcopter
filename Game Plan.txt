Research Phase
1. What sensors do we need?
2. What communication protocols do the sensors use?
3. What microcontroller are we going to use?
4. What kind of dev board are we going to use?
5. What libraries will we need to program(i.e. flight controller)?
6. What kind of motors are we going to use?
7. How heavy will the quadcopter be?
8. Optimal shape of quadcopter frame?
9. Optimal size of the quadcopter?
